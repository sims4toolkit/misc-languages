# Miscellaneous Languages

This repo contains various S4TK functionalities (e.g. hashing, STBL parsing,
etc.) implemented in miscellaneous programming languages.

## Disclaimer

This repo exists for my own practice with these languages, and they are only
shared in case others find them useful. **NO** code in this repository should
be considered ready for production, and if you're using it for reference, do so
very carefully.

For the most part, I do not know what I am doing in these languages, and I am 
just fiddling around with something a bit more advanced and "real" than a simple
Hello World or fibonacci function.
